How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The output was a result of all the differences between the 2 files. Hence by having a look at it the typo was clearly indentifiable.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It can help to undo things. Shows different versions of the program which can be used in the future to increase efficiency.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Convenience
    Cons - Need to see the history sometimes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    No idea

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log can be used to get the commit details and in turn we can use them to find the difference between two commits to know the history

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    The main reason being the ability to return back to any state regardless of the mistake that we make. This acts as a failsafe.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For Development of my programs
